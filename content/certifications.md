The tables below detail the different certificates I have obtained over the years. My total count of certificates doesn't directly correlate to the number of exams I've taken.

Each table will be listed in alphabetical order and grouped by vendor. Still, the overwhelming majority will be Cisco as they are, head and shoulders, the most recognised in our industry.
