## FOCUS 

Below are the core focus areas where I endeavour to hit one of the four sections each day. Other work will have been done if additional time becomes available, for example, while commuting or on lunch break at work. Different tasks include but are not limited to, flashcards, interleaving previous labs, reviewing notes, and researching available study materials for upcoming topics and weak areas.

## SUMMARY 

This week started off relatively slow. I kept oversleeping, and it took me a couple of days to get back into my routine after staying up late for the Boxing on Saturday night. 

Despite the slow start, I did manage to add the following to the completed items checklist below: 

+ Cisco U - Catalyst SD-WAN Upgrade 
+ Cisco U - SD-WAN Operation and Deployment 
+ Cisco Press - CCIE Routing and Switching v5.0 Official Cert Guide, Volume 1 

The Cisco U SD-WAN Operation and Deployment course was part of Cisco's RevUp to Recert series, allowing me to earn an additional 12 continuing education credits for free. There were five assisted labs; each one took approximately an hour to spin up and was running newer software than what I have in EVE-NG. The new GUI is cleaner and very similar to DNAC, ISE and Firepower (sorry, Secure Firewall) - which I like. 

I made my way through the OCG Volume 1. It's definitely one of the better books that I have read. However, I did not read this in the traditional way which proved to be very time consuming. I incorporated my own spin on the SQ4R study methodology with manual spaced repetition and active recall. It proved to be time consuming and cumbersome but the retention is definitely there. I tried to manage the review intervals with a formula on my 'master spreadsheet', which wasn't efficient; the next time I practice this, I will create a new deck on Anki to save time doing this in a spreadsheet. 

Next week, I plan to start Narbik's highly coveted CCIE Foundation Cisco Press book, and I have signed up for another live event by Russ White on O'Reilly called **[Modern Network Troubleshooting](https://www.oreilly.com/live-events/modern-network-troubleshooting/0790145043580/0790145043571/)**.
