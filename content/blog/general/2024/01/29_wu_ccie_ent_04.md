## FOCUS 

Below are the core focus areas where I endeavour to hit one of the four sections each day. Other work will have been done if additional time becomes available, for example, while commuting or on lunch break at work. Different tasks include but are not limited to, flashcards, interleaving previous labs, reviewing notes, and researching available study materials for upcoming topics and weak areas.

## SUMMARY 

A mediocre week that tailed off over the weekend. Some of the labs in the Cisco Press book were repetitive for spanning tree, but I have tried to create a new note type for the Lab Scheduling deck in Anki. These new notes will allow for 'text input' for the tasks on each card rather than having to spin up the relevant EVE-NG topology. 

The O'Reilly course with Russ was valuable and provided different perspectives on troubleshooting methodologies. What I took away was more relevant to the real world than the CCIE lab. However, I want to re-watch the class once the VOD is available and create more detailed notes.

No new content will be introduced next week. I am noticing that the return on watching the videos is diminishing quickly; this holds true whether I am labbing along or actively taking notes.
