Future goals would be to isolate my focus on the macro goal of sitting the CCIE lab. I frequently keep veering away through different distractions. There are a handful of reasons for this, but the main two that I bounce between are learning how to learn and work-related conundrums on non-Cisco hardware. 

Through trial and error, I'm more settled with the routine and the study plan I've put together. From now on, there is a clear path to get through, and the only genuine concern is keeping a balance to avoid any chance of burnout. 

At some point, I will have to book and pass the CCNP Enterprise core exam because I recertified using continuing education credits. Following Cisco's overhaul of the certification structure, the Core exam in your chosen tracks must be passed as a prerequisite before you can schedule the lab exams.
