Happy New Year. I aim to write a short blog post each week to review my progress towards the CCIE. 

These posts will track my studying time, the different areas covered, the resources used, and a summary of how well I digested the content.

## TIME

| Study Time     | Hours               |
|:---------------|:--------------------|
| **Last week**  | ```n/a```           |
| **This week**  | 31 hours 40 minutes |
| **2024 total** | 31 hours 40 minutes |

New Year's Day, a bank holiday here in England, allowed me to overachieve the 25 hours per week target.

_NOTE: These are the core focus areas where I endeavour to hit one of the four sections each day. Other work will have been done if additional time becomes available, for example, while commuting or on lunch break at work. Different tasks include but are not limited to, flashcards, interleaving previous labs, reviewing notes, and researching available study materials for upcoming topics and weak areas._

## SUMMARY 

I finished reading **[Cisco IP Routing: Packet Forwarding and Intra-domain Routing Protocols](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6327824-cisco-ip-routing)** by Alex Zinin. Some of the content is a little dated, but it is one of the better books I've read; the following chapters were the most useful: 

+ Ch. 3 - Routing and Forwarding Processes
+ Ch. 4 - Routing Table Maintenance 
+ Ch. 5 - Packet Forwarding
+ Ch. 9 - Link-State Routing Protocols 

It was interesting to read about the low-level details on the routing table hierarchy, particularly with examples of how certain functions are called to install routes with references to the underlying IOS code syntax. This is more detail than is needed for the CCIE lab but it will help with the bigger picture long term. 

The next book I will read is **[Developing IP Multicast Networks](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/583421.Developing_Ip_Multicast_Networks)** by Beau Williamson. This should be a shorter read as some chapters cover topics that aren't part of the blueprint or used in the real world. For example, DVMRP, MOSPF, and ATM Networks.
