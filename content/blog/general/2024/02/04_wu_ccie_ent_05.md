## FOCUS 

Below are the core focus areas where I endeavour to hit one of the four sections each day. Other work will have been done if additional time becomes available, for example, while commuting or on lunch break at work. Different tasks include but are not limited to, flashcards, interleaving previous labs, reviewing notes, and researching available study materials for upcoming topics and weak areas.

## SUMMARY 

It was a reasonably consistent week. Covering the RIP labs could have been skipped; however, from previous materials I've used, RIP is chosen to demonstrate some basic routing concepts. EIGRP was not covered in too much depth, totalling 110 pages. OSPF is next on the lab schedule; this section spans 396 pages for comparison. 

The Active Recall for the SD-WAN course could be improved upon. I did get sidetracked looking into a digital PKM system using Zettlekasten. While I like the idea, more time would be needed to look into the different application options, mainly [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) and [Protolyst](https://protolyst.org/).
