_What is instore for the immediate future?_

In the short term, I am looking to take the Fortinet NSE4 exam before my probation ends at my new job. My probation end date is 4th July, and I have booked the exam for 30th June. 

At the start of the year, I  started a new job moving to an MSP after only working for ISPs in my career so far. This has introduced a lot of variety, not only from a vendor perspective but also by giving me exposure to new technologies across all network domains end to end instead of being isolated to predominantly the WAN. 

Some of the new vendors I'm now working with, in alphabetical order, are:

+ Alcatel-Lucient (Nokia)
+ Aruba 
+ Bluecoat
+ Forcepoint
+ Fortinet
+ Meraki
+ Palo Alto 

Some of the new technologies, domains, or products of note: 

+ Cloud
+ DNA Centre
+ ISE
+ SASE
+ SD-Access
+ SD-WAN
+ Wireless

There's a lot of variety, and while a little bit overwhelming, I started wondering what to learn to get up to speed. I've quickly realised that there's a lot of cross-over and overlap, particularly with the security products. Most of it will come with time from on-the-job experience.

Working for an MSP, there is often partner status requirements with different vendors to seek or retain. I've never had to support an employer with this in the past. Any certifications I've acquired over the years have been for my own personal development and majority of the time, out of my own pocket too. Having the materials and resources at my fingertips for learning and development is refreshing. It would be foolish not to make use of them, providing I have the time. 

I have two concerns that may never materialise, but I will mention them. What if I am asked to collect them like Pokemon cards and then expected to renew them, this would be a nightmare to keep on top of and manage. My other concern is more of a fear of spreading myself too thin or becoming a jack of all trades and a master of none, as they say.

Beyond the Fortinet NSE4 exam, I'm not sure what will be next. I acquired my Juniper JNCIA earlier in the year but I already had some Junos experience from previous roles. My first thoughts when renewals are due would be NSE7 and JNCIS, but a lot can change over the upcoming years.
