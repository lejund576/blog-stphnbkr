One of the main things I neglected in my younger years was my education. Academically I was predicted to do well from the early national curriculum tests or 'SATs', but for one reason or another, I never took my education seriously. For brevity, I left school at 15. I got accepted into college on an IT course based on my predicted grades but dropped out after finding a part-time job. 

On reflection, when I look back at my school years, I think I just used to get bored more often than not, especially being forced to learn subjects that did not interest me. I ended up working on different dead-end jobs, not that there is anything wrong with general labour. In fact, I miss the honest 'graft' and getting outdoors. Unfortunately, the prospects for progression are limited, and the lack of job security can result in avoiding more long-term commitments, particularly financially. After the turmoil of working these different kinds of jobs with periods of unemployment mixed in, I knew that something had to change. In 2011 after the summer bank holiday, my luck was about to change. I accidentally landed on my feet, securing an office job on a Service Desk that has now materialised into a career. 

A couple of weeks into my new role, I was asked if I would be interested in fixing the faults instead of taking calls to log them. Getting off the phone and trying to solve problems appealed to me, I was then told about the CCNA and the NOC team we had for support downstairs if we could not provide a first-time fix. After finishing my shift that day, I went home to look into the CCNA a bit more. Much to my embarrassment, I realised that Cisco was not spelt _Sisqo_ after the infamous thong song. I noticed that my local college had a Cisco CCNA NetAcademy Discovery course that ran one night a week for two years. I signed up there and then. While an expensive and time-consuming pursuit to obtain a CCNA, it was a worthwhile investment that became an excellent foundation for me to build on in the coming years.

## Sustainability

Over the last 11 years, my career has been a period of steady, but not linear, exponential growth. My time has not been used most optimally or efficiently. Despite this, it has been progressive, sometimes drifting on the peripheral areas of my chosen discipline. Still, all were adding toward the bigger picture. 

What has enabled me to stay the course? Initially, the salaries and knowing the approximate ceiling of potential earnings that could be achieved from climbing the certification pyramids. I discovered pretty early on that this would not be sustainable for me. I would get bored easily, especially when attempting to learn topics that I would never have the opportunity to work on as part of my job. 

I learnt this lesson at my previous company the hard way. My CCNP R&S was up for renewal, and traditionally, most would retake the TSHOOT exam to recertify for another three years, I saw little value in doing that. I decided to build on my CCNA Security and try to pass one of the four CCNP Security exams to recertify. This did have some relevance to my role at the time as Lead Network Design Engineer. When I made this decision, Cisco refreshed the CCNP Security track to make it more up-to-date with our ever-evolving industry. 

The refresh happened around 2016, below is a summary of the now legacy security track update:

+ SECURE replaced by Implementing Cisco Secure Access Solutions (**SISAS**)
+ IPS replaced by Implementing Cisco Edge Network Security Solutions (**SITCS**)
+ FIREWALL replaced by Implementing Cisco Security Mobility Solutions (**SENSS**)
+ VPN replaced by Implementing Cisco Threat Control Solutions (**SIMOS**)

This was mildly annoying as it meant that there would be a slight wait for new or updated learning materials for the new exams to become available. In some cases, the new materials never became available. If I remember correctly, Cisco only released their official certification guides (OCG) for two of the four exams.

## The Bigger Picture

What does all of this mean? My usual approach to preparing for these exams was no longer viable. Work experience aside, my process for covering the exam topics consisted of reading the official certification guides, watching videos and trying to create my own practice labs where possible. 

In short, I had to learn how to learn. Different scientifically proven methodologies and techniques were researched and practised through trial and error. I will cover this in more detail in a future blog post.

While succeeding in achieving my second CCNP, the experience from learning how to learn has proven to be a lot more valuable than the knowledge gained from the certification itself. My mindset has since changed a great deal as a by-product. I have become more aware of myself, first and foremost, and the broader industry in my chosen career path. 

Hopefully, I can continue developing to become a better engineer over the coming months and years. I believe creating this blog is a small step in the right direction. As clich√© as it might be, if other people can learn anything from my journey, that is a very welcome bonus as we all move forward together, no matter the variance in strides.
