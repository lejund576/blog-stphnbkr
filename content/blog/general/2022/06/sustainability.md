Over the last 11 years, my career has been a period of steady, but not linear, growth. My time has not been used most optimally or efficiently. Despite this, it has been progressive, sometimes drifting on the peripheral areas of my chosen discipline. Still, all were adding toward the bigger picture. 

What has enabled me to stay the course? Initially, the salaries and knowing the approximate ceiling of potential earnings that could be achieved from climbing the certification pyramids. I discovered pretty early on that this would not be sustainable for me. I would get bored easily, especially when attempting to learn topics that I would never have the opportunity to work on as part of my job. 

I learnt this lesson at my previous company the hard way. My CCNP R&S was up for renewal, and traditionally, most would retake the TSHOOT exam to recertify for another three years, I saw little value in doing that. I decided to build on my CCNA Security and try to pass one of the four CCNP Security exams to recertify. This did have some relevance to my role at the time as Lead Network Design Engineer. When I made this decision, Cisco refreshed the CCNP Security track to make it more up-to-date with our ever-evolving industry. 

The refresh happened around 2016, below is a summary of the now legacy security track update:

+ SECURE replaced by Implementing Cisco Secure Access Solutions (**SISAS**)
+ IPS replaced by Implementing Cisco Edge Network Security Solutions (**SITCS**)
+ FIREWALL replaced by Implementing Cisco Security Mobility Solutions (**SENSS**)
+ VPN replaced by Implementing Cisco Threat Control Solutions (**SIMOS**)

This was mildly annoying as it meant that there would be a slight wait for new or updated learning materials for the new exams to become available. In some cases, the new materials never became available. If I remember correctly, Cisco only released their official certification guides (OCG) for two of the four exams.
