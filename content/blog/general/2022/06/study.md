commitment to life long learning

your learning ability decides your earning capacity

focusing on output instead of input

input is shallow learning
input examples are books, videos, blogs 

output is deep learning

after learning something from an input (video, book), you need to reflect on it (output)
after reflection you need to implement 
learning without implementation gives an illusion of competence 
share - best way to learn something is to teach it


learn - reflect - implement - share 

memory improvement - visualisation and association

Study session structure 

First 3 minutes is the warm up 
- get a feel of what it is you want to study 
- previewing the book/chapter 

tiresome process 

## Fortgetting Curve 

### Spaced Repetition 

### Active Recall 

four stages of learning to master something

1. unconciously incompetent 
we dont know what we dont know 

2. Become conciously incompetent 
practice basic concepts 

3. Concious competence 
kind of know what to do and are now doing it 

4. Unconcious competence 
can walk the path with eyes shut 
swing golf club not having to think
