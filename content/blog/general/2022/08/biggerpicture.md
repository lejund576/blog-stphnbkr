What does all of this mean? My usual approach to preparing for these exams was no longer viable. Work experience aside, my process for covering the exam topics consisted of reading the official certification guides, watching videos and trying to create my own practice labs where possible.

In short, I need to learn how to learn so that I can be more efficient with my time going forwards. Different scientifically proven methodologies and techniques were researched and practised through trial and error. I will cover this in more detail in a future blog post.

While succeeding in achieving my second CCNP, the experience from learning how to learn has proven to be a lot more valuable than the knowledge gained from the certification itself. My mindset has since changed a great deal as a by-product. I have become more aware of myself, first and foremost, and the broader industry in my chosen career path.

Hopefully, I can continue developing to become a better engineer over the coming months and years. I believe creating this blog is a small step in the right direction. As clich√© as it might be, if other people can learn anything from my journey, that is a very welcome bonus as we all move forward together, no matter the variance in strides.
