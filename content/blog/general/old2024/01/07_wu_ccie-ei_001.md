Happy New Year. I aim to write a short blog post each week to review my progress towards the CCIE. 

These posts will track my studying time, the different areas covered, the resources used, and a summary of how well I digested the content. 

_________________

## TIME

**Study time last week:** 20 hours 

**Study time this week:** 31 hours 40 minutes
 
**Yearly total study time:** 31 hours 40 minutes 


New Year's Day, a bank holiday here in England, allowed me to overachieve the 25 hours per week target.

## FOCUS 

**Labbing**
: INE CCIE R&S ATC - VPN Section 

**Active Recall**
: IGP Route Redistribution, Summarisation, Default Routing and Troubleshooting

**Reading**
: Cisco IP Routing: Packet Forwarding and Intra-domain Routing Protocols (Ch. 10 Enhanced IGRP)

**Videos**
: INE CCIE R&S ATC - MPLS


###### _NOTE: These are the core focus areas, other work will have been done for example flash cards, interleaving labs that have already been completed, and researching study materials for upcoming topics._

## SUMMARY 

I finished reading **[Cisco IP Routing: Packet Forwarding and Intra-domain Routing Protocols](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6327824-cisco-ip-routing)** by Alex Zinin. Some of the content is a little dated, but it is one of the better books I've read; the following chapters were the most useful: 

+ Ch. 3 - Routing and Forwarding Processes
+ Ch. 4 - Routing Table Maintenance 
+ Ch. 5 - Packet Forwarding
+ Ch. 9 - Link-State Routing Protocols 

It was interesting to read about the low-level details on the routing table hierarchy, particularly with examples of how certain functions are called to install routes with references to the underlying IOS code syntax. This is more detail than is needed for the CCIE lab but it will help with the bigger picture long term. 

The next book I will read is **[Developing IP Multicast Networks](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/583421.Developing_Ip_Multicast_Networks)** by Beau Williamson. This should be a shorter read as some chapters cover topics that aren't part of the blueprint or used in the real world. For example, DVMRP, MOSPF, and ATM Networks.
