2023 has been a productive year, not quite as efficient as I would have hoped, but I feel like I have made some significant progress towards my goals.

I started the year with the ambition to write a blog post each month to summarise my progress. Unfortunately, that never materialised, mostly because I went down a few rabbit holes in learning how to learn, which involved a lot of trial and error to understand what worked best for me. These tangents can be summarised as follows:

+ Zettlekasten index system 
+ Anki flashcard and optimal algorithms
+ Excel spreadsheet formulas
+ Active Recall, Spaced Repetition, SQ4R
+ Blooms Taxonomy, High Order Thinking
+ Knowledge vs Cognitive Process Dimensions
+ Artificial Intelligence for learning (GPT, Bard, Bing, etc.)

After researching the above topics at varying lengths, I have formulated a framework for my learning approach towards the CCIE Enterprise Infrastructure certification. The true acid test on how valuable these methodologies are in terms of time efficiency, depth of understanding and ability to recall will be better understood after passing the lab exam.

There is a certain prestige and mystique with any CCIE exam of being at the top of the certification pyramid for a chosen discipline in the networking field. I have a different mindset towards this in which I believe that obtaining a CCIE is the starting point for the real learning to begin.
