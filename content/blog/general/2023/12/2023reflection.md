2023 has been a productive year, not quite as efficient as I would have hoped, but I feel like I have made some significant progress towards my goals.

I started the year with the ambition to write a blog post each month to summarise my progress. Unfortunately, that never materialised, mostly because I went down a few rabbit holes in learning how to learn, which involved a lot of trial and error to understand what worked best for me. These tangents can be summarised as follows:

+ Zettlekasten index system 
+ Anki flashcard and optimal algorithms
+ Excel spreadsheet formulas
+ Active Recall, Spaced Repetition, SQ4R
+ Blooms Taxonomy, High Order Thinking
+ Knowledge vs Cognitive Process Dimensions
+ Artificial Intelligence for learning (GPT, Bard, Bing, etc.)

After researching the above topics at varying lengths, I have settled on a framework for my learning approach towards the CCIE Enterprise Infrastructure certification. The true acid test on how valuable these methodologies are in terms of time efficiency, depth of understanding and ability to recall will be better understood after passing the lab exam.

There is a certain prestige and mystique with any CCIE exam of being at the top of the certification pyramid for a chosen discipline in the networking field. I have a different mindset towards this in which I believe that obtaining a CCIE is the starting point for the real learning to begin.

## TIME

| Total | Value |
|------|-------|
| Study Time | 1,227 hours 10 minutes |
| Books Completed | 5 | 
| Pages Read | 3765 |
| Reading Time | 85 hours 56 minutes |
| Video Courses Completed | 5 | 
| Videos Watched | 1215 | 
| Watching Time | 269 hours 13 minutes | 
| Labbing Time | 200 hours 15 minutes  | 
| Labs Completed | 703 | 

The total recorded hours are not specific to the CCIE pursuit, some statistics from the above table can be found below:

- **1,227** hours equates to 23.6 hours per day for the year
    - 7.01% of total study time for reading books
    - 21.92% of total study time for watching videos
    - 16.03% of total study time for workbook labs
- **672** hours uncategorised falls into the below areas
    - Researching on learning how to learn 
    - Training courses
    - Webinars 
    - Creating Anki cards
    - Creating lab topologies and startup-configs in EVE-NG
    - Updating the hybrid tracker-planner spreadsheet 
- **555** hours roughly spent focusing on the CCIE

Most of the time, studying was done between 04:30 and 08:45 AM each morning. The framework is broken down into completing pre-planned tasks each day in order of the following priority: 

> ``` 
> Labbing > Active Recall > Reading > Watching
> ```

If the planned tasks were complete for the day, I would use any spare time to review the Anki question cards, mostly built from the end-of-chapter quizzes in the books I've read. If the algorithm was up to date for the Q&A decks, time permitting, I would move on to the lab scheduling card decks to revisit labs from topics. 

This time next year, the labbing hours will make up for most of the total hours, hopefully having successfully passed the lab exam.
