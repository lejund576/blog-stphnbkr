I'm Steve; welcome to my personal website.

Ideally, I would have liked to have registered my full name as the domain name, but it was taken, _stphnbkr_ is an abbreviation of my full name after dropping the vowels. This will most likely be changed as it is difficult to communicate if anyone asks for the website address.

My professional career in telecommunications started in 2011 by accident after struggling to find employment for almost a year. Before the interview, I was under the impression that I had applied for a job at a recruitment agency, but this was not the case.

It turns out that I was being interviewed for a job on the service desk of a global Internet Service Provider (ISP). During the interview, I was asked a few light technical questions, which I could wing the answers to a little bit. I was able to do this from experience I gained after spending a lot of time on the Internet throughout my adolescence. Most of this experience was related to online gaming. Having a younger brother who played professionally in tournaments worldwide, you will quickly pick up on words like **‘ping’** and **‘lag’**.

A few months into starting the job, I was asked if I would be interested in fixing the faults instead of receiving the calls to log and pass them on to another team to fix. Getting off the phone and solving problems appealed to me, and I explained that I would be interested in doing this. I was then told about the CCNA and the NOC team we had for support downstairs if we could not fix the faults.

After finishing my shift that day, I went home to look into the CCNA a bit more, and much to my embarrassment, I realised that Cisco was not spelt ‘Sisqo’ after the infamous thong song. I noticed that my local college had a Cisco CCNA NetAcademy Discovery course that ran one night a week for two years. I enrolled immediately. In retrospect, I was fortunate because it was the last week to register before the course started later the same month.

The course was broken up into four semesters over two years. The first two semesters covered the topics for the ICND1 (CCENT) exam, semesters three and four would make up the second half covering the remaining topics required for the ICND2 (CCNA). Back then, to become certified, there were two approaches you could take.

>  1) Two exam route: ICND1 (CCENT) and then the ICND2 (CCNA)
>  2) One exam route: Full CCNA exam (tested on all ICND1 and ICND2 topics in a single exam)

Taking the two exams was more in line with the evening course I had paid for. If I remember correctly, if you went for the single exam, you had to be much quicker with subnetting.

Fast forward 11 years to the present day, I’m still in the same industry and working for a service provider. I’ve had a progressive career so far, gaining a lot of experience across design, deployment, maintenance and administration.

I’ve collected a few more certifications along the way, which will no doubt continue further into my career as there will always be something new to learn. This, in part, is a big reason for the blog and will make up much of the content here.
