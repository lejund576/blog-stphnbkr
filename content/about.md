I'm Steve; welcome to my personal website.

Ideally, I would have liked to have registered my full name as the domain name, but most variations I could think of were taken. **_stphnbkr_** is an abbreviation of my full name after dropping the vowels. This will most likely be changed as it is difficult to communicate if anyone asks for the website address.

I'm a multi-vendor certified network engineer from Manchester, UK. I've been working in the industry since 2011 on Internet Service Provider (ISP) networks up until recently. At the start of this year (2022), I took a slightly different direction in my career and joined a Managed Service Provider (MSP) to gain exposure and experience with new products and technologies. 

Now six months into my new role, the experience has been quite eye-opening as to just how comfortable I have become. The primary reason for starting this blog is to keep me accountable for continuous learning and development to avoid becoming too comfortable or stagnating again. Secondly, I would like to document any future certification pursuits and hopefully build up a profile in an alternative way to social media.
